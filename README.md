# PROJECT ZERO - TIC TAC TOE:
Follow my link to play Tic-tac-toe V1: https://tjhunt03.github.io/tic-tac-toe/


## Description:

The main objective of this project was designed to test our creativity and solve challenges  developers encounter using multiple front end languages to create a simple Tic-tac-toe game.

Tic tac toe is a game played with two players, X and O. A game played on a 3x3 board in which the winner is determined by a player placing their mark in a row of 3 first. Rows can be made horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
